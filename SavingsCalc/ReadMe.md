## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This program offered the user an opportunity for users to test different savings strategies. While the subject matter is close to my own heart, it is not interesting to many. It does, though, show how compounded interest with even modest savings strategies, can add up relatively quickly.

## What I did well

I liked my strategy for the SavingsAnnually class. I flip-flopped on this, starting with annual, then changing to monthly, then back to annual. I think this makes does a nice job and will actually keep it maintainable.

## Code enhancements

I think there is an opportunity to have a class for monthly savings and use that as a nested class within annual savings. This might be an interesting enhancement. I think maybe making the output look nicer would be a quicker fix and ultimately a better choice for immediate enhancement.

## Challenging parts

Definitely choosing what to abstract at the class level. Ultimately I chose annual savings, which made more sense given the data to be displayed.

## Transferable skills

Pointers are a great thing to understand and are very transferable. Using them in this way is also very helpful to know. There are many applications where this can be applied.

## Maintainability

I think for maintainability I did a decent job starting with the annual savings class. I also kept the main function light, leaving the work to the helper file and the class.
